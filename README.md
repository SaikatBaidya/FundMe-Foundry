# About
This is a crowd sourcing app. It works as a web3 decentralized kickstarter. This app allows users to send native blockchain cryptocurrency like Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, etc. into this contract. The owner of the contract can then withdraw these funds.
I have also coded in an ETH/USD price converter using the chainlink oracle.
- Added functionality so that contract can be deployed on multiple chains with different addresses.
- Added 3 tests
- Added functionality to run tests on chain forks
